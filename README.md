### Monpoly CLI
This application allows you to play monopoly from the command line. Simply compile the Game.java file, run it, and the CLI interface for the game will initiate. Select the number of players that will be playing, then start your game. Each player can roll, buy/sell properties, and purchase houses/hotels. 

The game logic and execution structure resides in the Monopoly.java file. It is composed of a BoardState object which keeps track of all game/player information.
